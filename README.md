`warning: this is a fossil repository, will never be updated. it stays as it is.`

in 2015 i started programming, i was learning C++, my first program ever was that one with 3000 lines.

this repo represents what were the best results from 2015 to 2019. any project, any language that i learn back then.

ofc i was a junior and probably made stupid and unclean code, but hey, there should always be a starting point.
